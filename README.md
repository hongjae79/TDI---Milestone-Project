Using Binder to Host your Notebooks

Binder is a great and free service that makes it easy for someone to share their Jupyter notebooks for others to both view and run. Binder works by taking a GitHub repository and building a Docker image. Using JupyterHub, Binder runs a Docker container of the built Docker image.
